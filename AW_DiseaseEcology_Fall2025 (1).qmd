Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {area <- pi*radius^2
return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

DiseThe epidemiological triangle helps illustrate how diseases occurs via the interaction between host, environment, and pathogen, when any one of the three factors falls out of equilibrium or becomes unstable, then disease is likely to occur. For example: When temperature rises (altering the environment) this often causes stress to the host, thus allowing for pathogens to invade immunologically compromised hosts due to elevated stress levels.
