Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {area <- pi*radius^2
return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triangle helps illustrate how diseases occurs via the interaction between host, environment, and pathogen, when any one of the three factors falls out of equilibrium or becomes unstable, then disease is likely to occur. For example: When temperature rises (altering the environment) this often causes stress to the host, thus allowing for pathogens to invade immunologically compromised hosts due to elevated stress levels.

1\. Sample size necessary to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in 5000 deer with 95% confidence is: [**59 samples**]{.underline}

2\. With a large population of 50,000 the sample sizes for:

A)  95% confidence in detecting disease at 1% prevalence is: [**299samples**]{.underline}

While the samples size needed in the same population (50,000) for:

B)  99% confidence in detecting disease at 2% prevalence is: [**229 samples**]{.underline}

So, scenario **A** requires [**more**]{.underline} samples to be taken then scenario **B**.

3.  Based on the findings that 300 deer sampled from a herd of 4000 had no antibodies detected against EHD, I am 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is: [**\<1%**]{.underline}

Worksheet 3 ![](images/clipboard-236174008.png)

Incidence= \# of new cases on that day/ the at risk animals during that time

A.  

-   Incidence on **06/12/25**= [**0.098 cases per elk per day**]{.underline}

*Work: Population total: 56*

*On the previous day (06/11/25) 5 elk were already sick with 0 elk recovered so the number of the at risk population: 56-5= **51***

*Number of new cases on 06/12/25: **5/51= 0.098 cases per elk day***

-   Incidence on **06/14/25**= [**0.049 cases per elk per day**]{.underline}

*Work: Population total: 56*

*On the previous day (06/13/25) 12 elk were already sick and 3 elk had recovered so they are no longer at risk thus the number of the at risk population: 56-15= **41***

*Number of new cases on 06/14/25: **2/41 =0.049 cases per elk per day***

-   Incidence on **06/15/25**= [**0 cases per elk per day**]{.underline}

*Work: Population total: 56*

*Number of new cases on 06/15/25: **There were 0 new cases of disease on day 15 so the incidence will be 0.***

B.  

Prevalence: \# infected/ size of host population

-   The prevalence on **06/13/25**= [**21.42% prevalence in the herd**]{.underline}

*Work: total population=56*

*Number infected= 12*

*math= 12/56= 0.214\*100= 21.42%*

-   The prevalence on **06/16/25= [8.93% prevalence in the herd]{.underline}**

*Work: total population=56*

*Number infected= 5*

*math= 5/56= 0.0893\*100= 8.93%*

C.  

The prevalence and incidence are the same on [**06/10/25**]{.underline}

D.  

The incidence was the lowest on [**06/15/25 and 06/16/25**]{.underline} because for both days there were no new cases meaning the incidence for both days was 0.
